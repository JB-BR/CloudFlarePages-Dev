# A new hope
Well, I have decided to play around with hugo and static pages. This is my first test. 

The goal of the whole process is:
1. To create my blog
2. To learn more about CloudFlare products and start with a easy one

This first blog has been created following those links: 
* Getting Started with Hugo: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/
* Getting Started with Hugo-Coder: https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/blob/main/docs/quick-start.md
* Hugo-Coder config example: https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/blob/main/docs/configurations.md#complete-example
* Creating Hugo sites with CloudFlare pages: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-hugo-site/
